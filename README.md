This GitHub repository was created to feature the outline of my role at the Geant sim development to “show off” in front of recruiters. 
The folder QD contains the original code for the sim that was used in the https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10122 paper. 
!!!! Paste its geometry pic !!!
My role was adding quantum efficiency to the PMT,  emission spectrum to the quantum dots and refining the geometry. Hits in the PMT were 
counted and analysed !!!paste pic of hits histogram!!!. As well, I have, with equal success, applied the gaussian smearing to the used 
data tables
!!! Paste picture of smearing!!!
Another part of this project was to test teflon for the Hyper-K (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-Kamiokande) experiment.
The practice setup was cad-ded and built in the Kcl lab 
 ![cad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnastasiiaTea/newProject/main/Git/HyperK_CAD.jpg)), 
In the sim it looked like this:
 ![geo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnastasiiaTea/newProject/main/Git/GearsHyperK.jpg)), 
 ![pmt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnastasiiaTea/newProject/main/Git/PMT.jpg)), 
The whole work will be once documented with Latex (at which I’m good:  ![tikz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnastasiiaTea/newProject/main/Git/TikzDiagram.jpg)), 
just like my simpler projects, including the lab project on shape detection : measurement of surface energies by measuring contact angles: 
 ![droplets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnastasiiaTea/newProject/main/Git/Droplet.jpg)
Paste another pic!!!. T
his work had a manim movie: ![manim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnastasiiaTea/newProject/main/Git/Manim.jpg)
so will this big Geant project.
